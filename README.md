Now that I've inserted the project files I will start by completing the assignments. 

I finished assignment 1 and 2 so I will move onto assignment 3.

I've completed all assignments but found a bug so I will fix it.

I used quotes instead of tick marks for the loop which was causing error, I've fixed it so the program now runs smoothly.
